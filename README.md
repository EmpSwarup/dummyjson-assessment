# Project Overview

In this project, I harnessed the capabilities of Next.js and seamlessly integrated the dummyJSON API (https://dummyjson.com/docs) to craft a dynamic web application that excels in the following functionalities:

### User Authentication

- Implemented a robust login system within the application.
- Successfully retrieved and prominently displayed the user's email from the login response.

### Product Listing

- Developed a comprehensive product listing feature, showcasing all available products.
- Implemented a user-friendly pagination mechanism, allowing seamless navigation through the list of products.

### Product Details

- Implemented an intuitive feature enabling users to access detailed information about a specific product.
- Ensured that the product details are presented in a clear and user-friendly manner.

### Product Categories

- Established a seamless interface for users to explore and discover all available product categories.
- Implemented a streamlined process for users to view products within a selected category, enhancing the overall user journey.

### Category Distribution Chart

- Leveraged the power of Chart.js to integrate an insightful pie chart.
- Visualized the distribution of products across different categories, providing users with a quick and engaging overview.

These functionalities collectively contribute to a well-rounded and user-centric web application, where users can seamlessly navigate, explore products, and gain valuable insights into product distribution.

Feel free to explore the application and experience these features firsthand!
